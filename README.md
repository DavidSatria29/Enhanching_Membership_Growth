# Enhancing Membership Growth for Cyclistic

## Overview
This project is part of a **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**, focusing on analyzing historical bike trip data to understand the differences in behavior between casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic. By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to design effective marketing strategies to increase annual memberships.

## Objective
The primary goals of this project are:
- To understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
- To identify trends and patterns in rider behavior.
- To recommend actionable marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Case Study Context
Cyclistic is a bike-share program in Chicago that features over **5,800 bicycles** and **600 docking stations**, offering traditional bikes and assistive options like reclining bikes and cargo bikes. While most riders use bikes for leisure, around 30% use them to commute daily. 

The **finance analysts** at Cyclistic concluded that **annual members are more profitable** than casual riders. Hence, the director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes the company’s future success relies on maximizing annual memberships by converting casual riders into members. The project involves analyzing Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to uncover insights that inform marketing strategies aimed at achieving this goal.
